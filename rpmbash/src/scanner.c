/**
 * RPMBash external scanner
 *
 * This scanner extends tree-sitter-bash with RPM-specific newline handling.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM:
 * In bash, newlines can be statement terminators OR insignificant whitespace
 * (when the parser is looking for more command arguments). The bash scanner
 * handles this by returning NEWLINE tokens only in certain contexts.
 *
 * When RPM statements like %global or %define appear after a bash command,
 * we need the newline between them to act as a statement terminator:
 *
 *     export FOO="bar"     <- bash command
 *     %global name value   <- RPM statement (must be separate)
 *
 * Without intervention, the bash scanner might skip the newline while looking
 * for more arguments to 'export', causing %global to be parsed as part of the
 * previous command.
 *
 * THE SOLUTION:
 * We peek ahead when we see a newline. If the next non-whitespace content is
 * an RPM keyword (%global, %define, %if, etc.), we force-return a NEWLINE
 * token to terminate the previous bash command.
 *
 * KEY INSIGHT - Lexer Position vs Token Boundaries:
 * In tree-sitter scanners, lexer->advance() moves the read position forward,
 * while lexer->mark_end() sets where the token ends IF we return true.
 * When returning false, tree-sitter resets the lexer to its original position.
 *
 * CRITICAL: If we advance the lexer to peek ahead but then want to delegate
 * to the bash scanner, we CANNOT do so - the bash scanner would see the
 * already-advanced position. Instead, we must return false and let tree-sitter
 * reset the lexer, then the grammar's own rules will handle the newline.
